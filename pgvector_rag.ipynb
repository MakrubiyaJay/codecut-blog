        "Have you ever struggled to find information across different systems in your organization? Many organizations face this critical challenge: their valuable knowledge is scattered across different systems and formats. To find the information they need, they often have to search through multiple systems, which is time-consuming and inefficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "pgvector brings vector search capabilities to PostgreSQL, enabling fast and accurate information retrieval using large language models (LLMs). When used in a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup, pgvector helps you build AI-powered search solutions that index and retrieve organizational knowledge with precision.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this article, we'll build a simple RAG system using pgvector and Ollama.\n",

        "### What Is Ollama?\n",
        "\n",
        "Ollama is a lightweight, open-source model server that allows you to run and interact with large language models (LLMs) on your local machine. It provides a simple interface for running and managing LLMs, making it easy to experiment with different models and fine-tune them for your specific use cases.\n",
        "\n",
        "For more information on using Ollama in private AI workflows, check out this [guide](https://codecut.ai/private-ai-workflows-langchain-ollama).\n",

        "### What is pgvector?\n",
        "\n",
        "[pgvector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) is a PostgreSQL extension that provides vector similarity search capabilities. It allows you to store and query vector embeddings in your PostgreSQL database.\n",
        "\n",
        "[pgvector-python](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector-python) is a Python library for pgvector. It allows you to use pgvector with SQLAlchemy, making it easy to integrate pgvector into your existing Python applications.\n",
        "\n",
        "### What Is SQLAlchemy?\n",
        "\n",
        "[SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/) is a Python library for interacting with databases. It provides a simple interface for executing SQL queries and managing database connections.\n",
