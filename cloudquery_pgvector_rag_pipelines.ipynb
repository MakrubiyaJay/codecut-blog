        "\n",
        "Let's explore some of the other features of CloudQuery to enhance your pipeline.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Multi-Destination Support\n",
        "\n",
        "CloudQuery can route the same source data to multiple destinations in a single sync operation:\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "destinations: [\"postgresql\", \"bigquery\", \"s3\"]\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "This capability means you can simultaneously:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Store operational data in PostgreSQL for real-time queries\n",
        "- Load analytical data into BigQuery for data warehousing\n",
        "- Archive raw data to S3 for compliance and backup\n",
        "\n",
        "### Write Modes\n",
        "\n",
        "CloudQuery provides different write modes to control how data updates are handled:\n",
        "\n",
        "**Smart Incremental Updates:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Smart incremental updates is the default write mode and is recommended for most use cases. It updates existing records and removes any data that's no longer present in the source. This is perfect for maintaining accurate, up-to-date datasets where items can be deleted or modified.\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "write_mode: \"overwrite-delete-stale\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Append-Only Mode:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Append-only mode only adds new data without modifying existing records. Ideal for time-series data, logs, or when you want to preserve historical versions of records.\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "write_mode: \"append\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "**Selective Overwrite:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Selective overwrite mode replaces existing records with matching primary keys but doesn't remove stale data. Useful when you know the source data is complete but want to keep orphaned records.\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "write_mode: \"overwrite\"\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Performance Batching\n",
        "\n",
        "You can optimize memory usage and database performance by configuring the batch size and timeout:\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "spec:\n",
        "  batch_size: 1000              # Records per batch\n",
        "  batch_size_bytes: 4194304     # 4MB memory limit\n",

        "\n",
        "Details of the parameters:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`batch_size`**: Number of records grouped together before writing.\n",
        "- **`batch_size_bytes`**: Maximum memory size per batch in bytes.\n",
        "- **`batch_timeout`**: Time limit before writing partial batches.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Retry Handling\n",
        "\n",
        "The `max_retries` parameter ensures reliable data delivery by automatically retrying failed write operations a specified number of times before marking them as permanently failed.\n",
        "\n",
        "```yaml\n",
        "spec:\n",
        "  max_retries: 5                # Number of retry attempts\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Time-Based Incremental Syncing\n",
        "\n",
