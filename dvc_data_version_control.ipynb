        "As a data scientist, you're constantly iterating on datasets, model configurations, and code. Reproducing past experiments becomes difficult without a system for data version control that keeps data and models in sync with code changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Git excels at versioning source code, but it's not well-suited for tracking data and models for two major limitations:\n",

        "- Storing big binaries inflates the repository and slows down Git operations.\n",
        "- Changes in binary files can't be meaningfully tracked.\n",

        "- Track and store datasets alongside Git-managed code\n",
        "- Build reproducible pipelines and log models with MLflow\n",

        "## What Is DVC?\n",
        "\n",
        "[DVC](https://dvc.org/doc/start) is an open-source tool that brings data and model versioning into Git workflows. Instead of storing bulky files directly in Git, DVC saves them in external storage and tracks their metadata with lightweight `.dvc` files.\n",
