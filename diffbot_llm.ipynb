        "To understand how [Diffbot LLM](https://github.com/diffbot/diffbot-llm-inference?tab=readme-ov-file) delivers those reliable, cited responses, we need to examine the architectural philosophy behind its design and the performance metrics that validate this approach.\n",
        "\n",
        "### The GraphRAG philosophy {#the-graphrag-philosophy}\n",
        "\n",
        "Diffbot's approach represents a fundamental shift in AI architecture: instead of building ever-larger models that memorize more facts, they built smaller models that excel at finding and using external knowledge. This design challenges the \"bigger is better\" mindset, showing a 70B model with live data can outperform larger models on factual tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "This architecture recognizes that facts change constantly while reasoning abilities remain stable. Rather than spending compute on memorizing Wikipedia, Diffbot fine-tuned models to become expert users of APIs, search engines, and code interpreters.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, instead of memorizing static facts like \"Who is the CEO of Pfizer?\", Diffbot trains its model to make a real-time API call using a query like `type:Organization name:\"Pfizer\"` with the [Diffbot Knowledge Graph API](https://www.diffbot.com/products/knowledge-graph/).\n",

        "Diffbot's system has three main components working together. The Knowledge Graph contains over 10 billion entities and their relationships, continuously ingesting new information from millions of web pages since 2016. This creates a living map of factual knowledge spanning organizations, people, products, and events.\n",
        "\n",
        "The system's architecture includes:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Knowledge Graph** – 10+ billion entities with 1+ trillion facts, updated every 4-5 days\n",
        "- **Fine-tuned models** – 8B parameter and 70B parameter versions that can run on a single A100 or dual H100 GPUs, respectively\n",
        "- **Real-time web search** – Direct access to current web pages\n",
        "- **Code interpreter** – Executes JavaScript to compute answers directly, ensuring accuracy and transparency without relying on guesswork.\n",
        "- **Multimodal capabilities** – Understands and analyzes images through built-in visual reasoning tools\n",
        "\n",
        "Rather than memorizing facts, Diffbot fine-tuned the model to become an expert tool user, providing accurate results with full transparency.\n",

        "- **MMLU-Pro** – 70.36% on academic knowledge (best open-source under 100B parameters)\n",
        "- **SimpleQA** – Outperformed all models including Perplexity Sonar Pro and Gemini-2.0-flash\n",
        "- **Citation accuracy** – Every claim linked to verifiable sources\n",
