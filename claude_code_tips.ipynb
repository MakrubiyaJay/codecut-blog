        "\n",
        "I learned this the hard way: asking Claude to code without planning is like building without blueprints. You end up with a structure that works but needs major renovations later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start with planning mode instead. Use Shift+Tab twice to enter plan mode where Claude can only read and analyze your code. It will design the solution architecture first, then you approve before any actual coding happens.\n",

        "## Write specific prompts with clear goals\n",
        "\n",
        "I see this mistake constantly: developers send vague requests then wonder why Claude delivers something completely different.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Bad:** Build a model to identify churning customers\n",
        "\n",
        "Claude can't read your mind. Give it context, explain what you're trying to achieve, and share your project goals. I've found that being specific about your end goal dramatically improves Claude's solutions.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Good:** I have customer transaction data and need to identify churning customers. My goal is to build a simple model that my team can use to prioritize retention efforts.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Request multiple solutions upfront\n",
        "\n",
        "I used to make this mistake: ask for one solution, get something mediocre, then either accept it or waste time iterating.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Bad:** \"Help me improve my model accuracy\"\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Result: Claude gives a mediocre solution that I have to iterate on.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now I always ask for several approaches. Claude shows you different ways to solve the problem, and you pick the one that fits best.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Good:** \"Give me 3 approaches to improve my model accuracy\"\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Result: Claude gives me 3 different approaches to choose from.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Start simple, then add complexity\n",
        "\n",
        "Claude defaults to enterprise-level solutions even for simple problems. It's like asking for a basic calculator and getting a full accounting system - technically impressive but not what you need.\n",

        "> **Bad:** Build a dashboard for my data\n",
        ">\n",
        "> Result: Claude creates a full-stack application.\n",
        "\n",
        "Start simple instead. Ask Claude to break your project into phases where each phase works and can be tested. Phase 1 should be easy to implement but provide immediate value. Each phase builds naturally to the next. This way, you build exactly what's relevant to you.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Good:** Build a dashboard for my data. Break it down into multiple phases.\n",
        ">\n",

        "## Guide Claude when it goes off track\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't assume good planning means you can step away. Claude will still misinterpret things sometimes, so keep an eye on what it's actually doing.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Claude goes down the wrong path, like examining irrelevant files, guide it back on track. Think of these course corrections as training opportunities to make your future instructions clearer.\n",

        "## Let Claude handle your Git workflow\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't manually run git commands when Claude can handle your entire workflow. I used to generate code with Claude, then manually handle all the version control myself.\n",

        "> **Bad:** \n",
        ">\n",
        "> - Switch to terminal \n",

        "> - git push \n",
        "> - Back to Claude\n",
        "\n",
        "Let Claude manage your Git workflow instead. Use natural language to commit, create branches, push changes, and even create pull requests. It's seamless and much faster.\n",

        "\n",
        "## Make frequent, focused commits\n",
        "\n",
        "Don't commit Claude's work in huge batches without review. I learned this lesson when Claude introduced subtle bugs that took hours to track down later.\n",
        "\n",
        "Commit regularly with clear messages so you can see exactly what changed. Always review the diff before committing. Treat Claude's code like any other developer's work that needs scrutiny.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Design focused, reusable slash commands\n",
        "\n",
        "Slash commands are custom Claude Code commands for repeated tasks ([docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/slash-commands)). I treat them like functions in my code - if they try to do too many things, they become messy and hard to reuse.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Bad:** /deploy → \"Run tests, format code, build docs, update version, create release, deploy\"\n",
        "\n",
        "Keep each command focused on one task. This makes them readable, reusable across projects, and easy to combine when you need complex workflows.\n",
        "\n",
        "> **Good:** /test, /format, /build-docs, /bump-version, /create-release → Compose workflows\n",

        "\n",
        "CLAUDE.md files contain project-specific instructions that guide Claude Code's behavior ([docs](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code/memory)). Don't let yours become a junk drawer of random instructions. I used to add every tip I found online, creating a confusing mess that made Claude less effective.\n",
        "\n",
        "Curate ruthlessly. Keep only what you actually use, eliminate duplicates, and write clear instructions for your specific needs. Simple beats fancy every time."
