The bearish side warns of bubble-like valuation, heavy customer concentration, rising competition, geopolitical risks, and the potential for hardware cycle reversals. The chairman ultimately recommends a HOLD or further research, acknowledging both the powerful growth story and the elevated risks, making it prudent to wait for more clarity or a better entry point.\n",
