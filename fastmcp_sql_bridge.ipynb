        "AI has revolutionized how we write code, making complex database queries accessible to anyone who can describe what they need. But the workflow becomes frustrating when you're trapped in this repetitive cycle: ask your AI for SQL, copy the query, paste it into your database tool, run it, copy the results, and paste them back to your AI for analysis.\n",
