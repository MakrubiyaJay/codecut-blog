        "Have you ever struggled to create notebooks that are both interactive and reproducible? As a data scientist, it is common to rely on interactive workflows for exploration, but this often comes at the cost of consistency and repeatability.\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional environments like Jupyter, running cells out of order, depending on hidden state, and modifying variables mid-stream can easily lead to confusion and bugs.\n",

        "**[Marimo](https://github.com/marimo-team/marimo)** is a modern Python notebook that enforces reproducibility by design, supports interactive apps, and integrates seamlessly into your data science workflows. With Marimo, you no longer have to choose between interactivity and reproducibility—you get both in a single, consistent environment.\n",

        "Marimo solves three major issues common in traditional notebooks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Hidden state and out-of-order execution**\n",

        "Marimo enforces top-to-bottom execution with clear cell dependencies.\n",
        "2. **Version control and diffing**\n",

        "3. **Reusability and sharing**\n",
